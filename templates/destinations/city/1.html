    <p class="heading">The citizens of the fourteen-million-strong city of Rio de Janeiro call it the Cidade Marvilhosa â€“ and there canâ€™t be much argument about that. Although riven by inequality, Rio has great style.</p><br>
    <p class="heading">Its international renown is bolstered by a series of symbols that rank as some of the greatest landmarks in the world: the Corcovado mountain supporting the great statue of Christ the Redeemer; the rounded incline of the Sugar Loaf mountain, standing at the entrance to the bay; and the famous sweeps of Copacabana and Ipanema beaches, probably the most notable lengths of sand on the planet.</p>

        Itâ€™s a setting enhanced annually by the frenetic sensuality of Carnaval, an explosive celebration that â€“ for many people â€“ sums up Rio and its citizens, the cariocas. The major downside in a city given over to conspicuous consumption is the rapacious development that has engulfed Rio.
    </p><br>
        <p class="heading">As the rural poor, escaping drought and poverty in other regions of Brazil, swell Rioâ€™s population, the city has been squeezed like a toothpaste tube between mountains and sea, pushing its human contents ever further out along the coast. Over the decades, much of the cityâ€™s rich architectural heritage has been whittled away, along with the destruction of much of its natural environment.

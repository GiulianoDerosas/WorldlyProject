<h1>WELCOME TO BRAZIL ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·</h1>

<div>
    <p class="heading">Brazilians often say they live in a continent rather than a country. Itâ€™s an excusable exaggeration. The landmass is bigger than the United States if you exclude Alaska; the journey from Recife in the east to the western border with Peru is longer than that from London to Moscow, and the distance between the northern and southern borders is about the same as that between New York and Los Angeles. Brazil has no mountains to compare with its Andean neighbours, but in every other respect it has all the scenic â€“ and cultural â€“ variety you would expect from so vast a country.</p>

        <li>By far the largest country in South America, Brazil covers nearly half the continent and is only slightly smaller than the US, with an area of just over 8.5 million square kilometres. It shares a frontier with every South American country except Chile and Ecuador.</li><br>

        <li>Brazil has around 200 million inhabitants, making it the fifth most populous country in the world.</li> <br>

        <li>Almost ninety percent of Brazilâ€™s electricity is generated from hydropower, about six percent from fossil fuels and six percent from nuclear power. Brazil is becoming an important oil exporter, with new reserves recently discovered offshore from Rio.</li> <br>

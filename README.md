<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<h2 id="about-the-project"> :pencil: About The Project</h2>

<p align="justify"> 
 This Web-App was built to track multiple users' travel bucket lists. Users can also look up some interesting information on places they would like to visit and track the percentage of the world they have visited. This was my first ever "larger" project and was built in a week.
